Goal:
Compare 3 types of classifiers - Decision Tree, KN-neighbors, and Support Vector Machine - and their
ability to correctly classify between an example of benign and malicious traffic

Dataset:

Initial dataset structure:
[*] 80 features per each sample
[*] Traffic:

440.031 	Benign Traffic samples

252.673 	Attack samples DdoS
231.073 	Attack DoS Hulk
 10.293 	Attack DoS GoldenEye
  5.796 	Attack DoS SlowLoris
  5.499 	Attack DoS SlowHttpTest
     11 	Heartbleed
     
692.703 	All samples

Modified dataset:
As our primary goal was to distinguish between an example of benign and malicious traffic,
we artificially modified the original problem according to our needs. That is:
We selected 2 stratified samples of 5.000 samples each and saved them as train.csv and test.csv files respectively
to later use for training and testing.
Then, using the script BenignVSRestScript.py, we relabled the data in a fashion that each sample of 
Benign traffic was given a label value of 1 and each sample of attack traffic was given a label value
of 0

Preprocessing method:
In KN-neighbors and SVC we use MinMaxScaler as a preprocessing method, since our data features have a very big range of values
(for example, some of them are the quantity of bits/packages flowing). 
According to the sklearn library's manual, MinMaxScaler "transforms features by scaling each feature to a given range.
This estimator scales and translates each feature individually such that it is in the given range on the training set, 
e.g. between zero and one."

Decision Tree:
For a decision tree classifier we selected the most basic decision tree available in sklearn library.
No preprocessing or any other preparation of data was done for this classifier.

KN-neighbors:
We used the KN-neighbors classifier available in sklearn library. We considered a number of neighbors varying from
1 to 20, as well as preprocessing and no preprocessing of data with MinMaxScaler.
Corresponding file: KNeighbors.py

SVC:
We used a basic SVM - SVC - available in sklearn library. This type of classifier, according to sklearn library,
works worse with datasets that have more than 10.000 samples, but our datasets were fixed to 5.000 samples for training
and testing. 
Firstly, we evaluated the model with no preprocessing.
Secondly, we introduced preprocessing with MinMaxScaler.
Thirdly, we looked for the best pair of values of C and gamma for the classifier.

Conclusions:
1. The best classifer for this type of problem is a decision tree:
	- it is more computationally effective (the best running time result)
	- it doesn't require any preprocessing of data
	- it deals well with the features with values of very different sizes as well as with binary features
		that are present in the dataset, because it looks for the best feature that is going to be a base
		for the separation of 2 classes
	- it gives the best precision, recall, and accuracy values
	
2. The second best classifier for this problem is KN-neighbors:
	- it doesn't require preprocessing; in fact, preprocessing with MinMaxScaler only worsens the results:
		it increases the recall, but reduces precision, which is crucial for the problem (as a consequence,
		f1-score is also effected)
	- the best number of neighbors to be used seems to be 1-2 neighbors
	- without preprocessing KN-neighbors behaves better, because neighbors are close enough to each other to classify
		correctly, but if we rescale the features' values with MinMaxScaler, they might become too close together
		and in one area there will be more samples of different classes, which reduces overall accuracy of our
		classification
		
3. The last classifier is SVC:
	- without preprocessing SVC is only capable of achieving ~65% accuracy and precision, despite having good recall results
	- after preprocessing with MinMaxScaler it seems that the accuracy and precision improve by at least 20%
	- selecting C and gamma without preprocessing, despite whatever small or big values we take, doesn't improve the performance
		of the classifier; however, after preprocessing, even a small change in C and gamma seems to be affecting the performance 
		of the classifier more
	- the best value pair for C and gamma seems to be between 1 and 10, which might indicate that our margin is quite small
		and the hyperplane dividing the classes is quite straight
