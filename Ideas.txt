Burst Rate
Packet bursts are detected by counting the number of packets in a given time interval and comparing that count to the intervals across a window of time. Statistics for the interval with the maximum number of packets are shown. By default, bursts are detected across 5 millisecond intervals and intervals are compared across 100 millisecond windows.

These calculations can be adjusted in the “Statistics” section of the Preferences Dialog.

Burst Start
The start time, in seconds from the beginning of the capture, for the interval with the maximum number of packets.
You can show statistics for a portion of the capture by entering a display filter into the Display filter entry and pressing Apply.
