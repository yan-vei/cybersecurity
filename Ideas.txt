Benign vs Any DoS
Bening vs 1 type of DoS

- Normalise the features (columns)
- After normalise we can try one of the best system that is Nearest Neighbours (after weight and normalise)
- Try with a random small take, not the whole thing

Burst Rate
Packet bursts are detected by counting the number of packets in a given time interval and comparing that count to the intervals across a window of time. Statistics for the interval with the maximum number of packets are shown. By default, bursts are detected across 5 millisecond intervals and intervals are compared across 100 millisecond windows.

These calculations can be adjusted in the “Statistics” section of the Preferences Dialog.

Burst Start
The start time, in seconds from the beginning of the capture, for the interval with the maximum number of packets.
You can show statistics for a portion of the capture by entering a display filter into the Display filter entry and pressing Apply.











- Select 10.000 samples of the whole dataset 
- Split 10k in 5k test and 5k training, always the same. Depending on the classifier,
for example for SVM (as is really slow) we would take a sample of that 5k+5k sample, to
make it quicker. Select always Hulk. Try at least SVM with rbf (to have to choose the sigma
and the c margin)and Neighbours(keep the best case and compare it for the SVM and try to get it
with SVM) once we get a good result for SVM, we try it with the full 5k+5k, and leave it a long time
for the pc, just to know if is as good as we thought.
- If we have time, try forest or trees
